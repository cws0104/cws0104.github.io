<center> About Wonseok (Ethan), </center>

### <center> For future biomedical Engineering with therapeutic ultrasound </center>

I am a biomedical engineer with full research focused on ***therapeutic ultrasound***. I recently completed the Ph.D. studies at the Department of Biomedical Engineering in Yonsei University. My research experiences span through drug delivery system coupled with pulsed ultrasound, passive structures (e.g., hologram, metasurface, etc.), numerical analyses, and mechanical histotripsy. More detailed information for my publications can be found in **Research Section** above.
